		<h2><b> The Druid </b></h2>
		<p>
			Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds 
			lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet 
			undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of
			
			<box class = "test">
			<b>Role:</b> While some druids might keep to the fringe of 
			battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight 
			while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others 
			transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. 
			Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural 
			powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a 
			nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague 
			spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring 
			natural wonders.
			</box>
			
			philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and 
			manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of 
			the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten 
			them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock 
			themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with 
			incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting 
			abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to 
			call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to 
			storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long 
			abandoned and forgotten by civilization.

			<b> Armor and Weapon Proficiencies </b><br />
			Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, 
			dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, 
			and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks 
			(claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild 
			shape (see below).
			<br /><br />
			
			<box class = "test"> 
			A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield 
			is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural 
			or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours 
			thereafter. 
			</box>
			
			Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are 
			prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only 
			padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden 
			armor that has been altered by the ironwood spell so that it 
			functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient 
			with shields (except tower shields) but must use only wooden ones.
